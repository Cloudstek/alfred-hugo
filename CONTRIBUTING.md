# Contributing

In this document you'll find everything you need to know to start contributing. Your ideas, bug reports and code are all welcome! By following these guidelines you make it a lot easier for maintainers and the community to help you with your contribution.

**By participating, you are expected to have read, understand and respect the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**

## Submitting a bug report

* **Search existing issues.** There might already be issues related to your problem. In case of closed issues that match your problem, reply to them and explain what issues you are still having to re-open the issue.
* **Make sure the bug is related to Hugo** and not to any of the third-party libraries.
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Include short and documented examples** of code that cause the unexpected behaviour. *Do not* include your whole application and expect people to fix the problem for you.

## Contributing code

Want to lend a hand but not sure where to start? Check out the [list of open issues](https://github.com/Cloudstek/alfred-hugo/issues) to see if there's an issue you'd like to work on.

The best way to start contributing code is to fork the repository, make your changes and issue a [pull request](https://github.com/Cloudstek/alfred-hugo/pulls). To make sure your pull request can be accepted without any problems, check the list below:

* **Write and run [tests](github.com/avajs/ava)** to ensure everything is working as expected.
* **Use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to [lint](http://eslint.org) and [transpile](https://babeljs.io) your code.**
* **Include additional (dev)dependencies** in package.json using the `npm install` `save` and `save-dev` flags.
* **Update the README** to reflect your changes.
* Add yourself to the list of [contributors](README.md#contributors) :+1:
